*DataDrivenFrameWork: So basically Datadriven framework is nothing but it is driving the data from other sources the name itself it is saying that it is driven the
data from some extrenal files like excel files or CSV files or anyother.

* how we can fetch the data from excel file using Apachi poi librires ex: if i want to subitmit a form  with multiple set of data or I want to register in one 
application with diff set of data in that case we storing the data in excel sheets and then we will fetch the data in our selenium script.

* Datadriven approach is nothing but parametarization also

Note: when we are doing any write operation in excel sheet that sheet should be in closed status  for Reading or fetching the data it is not required 


* @dataprovider annotation is most papular annaotation in TestNG to fetch data from excel sheet i.e using dataprovider annotation we need to create method and pass
the string variable in the method itself

Note: Each and every annotation is followed one method

Data driven Approches:

1.From excel file -testdata
2.From Properties file - Env var or test data 
3.From TestNG.xml file - Env Var

these are the different kind of approches to drive the data from different resources.


PageObjectModel is an approach to write the test cases and its a designed pattern

>> it will be intigrating with Datadroven frame work and TestNg annotation to write the testcases

Lets assume that any application like ecommerce  in that application we have diff kind of pages are there ex: Loginpage,Homepage,Searchpage,Regpage,Addtocartpage...etc

using POM we need to create a java class for each and every page  and then we can define webelements of respective pages and perform some Actions  these are called Page Library's

and also its called as Object repository 

TestBase.java it is a parent class of the all classes 


TestNG: TestNG is nothing but Testing new generation framework. .Its a very powerfull toll Its have lot of feture and options to generate the testcases.

TestNg is Opensource and its available in the form of jar files. And it is also called Java unit testing framework 
its only applicable with java. 

Advantages:
1.Using TestNG we can generate a testcases in systamatic way
2.It will generate very good HTML reports.
3.It gives lot of Annotations 
4.Priorities/sequence which means we can prioritize our testcases with sequence manner.
5.Dependency feature available
6.grouping feature is available
7.important feature is @Dataprovider which means we can pass the different set of data using dataprovider feature.

When write the TestNG classes we never use main method.
